                                As a Korean-American creative, music has always been my passion, particularly in the realm of music production and audio engineering. 
                                For the past five years, I've immersed myself in the art of film score composition, driven by a deep-seated desire to connect with others through the power of music. 
                                Despite my love for this creative pursuit, the overwhelming influence technology has to offer prompted me to explore alternative career paths.

                                Recognizing my innate affinity for technology and computer science, I embarked on a journey to merge my passion for music with my newfound interest in the digital realm. 
                                Currently enrolled in Johnson County Community College, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems, laying the foundation for a future career as a software engineer. 
                                Upon completing my associate's degree, my ambition extends to diving deeper into the realms of machine learning and AI development, areas that captivate me personally and professionally.

                                One of my proudest accomplishments within the tech sphere was my participation in my first hackathon hosted by <a href="https://www.codedex.io/" target="_blank">Codedex.io.</a> 
                                Despite having only five months of coding experience under my belt, I, along with my team, created an interactive cassette player infused with holiday spirit. 
                                Throughout this experience, I honed my skills in file directory management, leveraged various technologies, delved into the intricacies of GitHub collaboration, and Flask as our backend framework.

                                What drives me in pursuing this field is the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on people's lives. 
                                Whether it's through crafting innovative solutions for accessibility or leveraging technology to enhance health, 
                                my goal is to harness the power of technology for the betterment of society.
